How to Use
--------------------------------------------
Connect to the MYSQL database provided by the client via connector MYSQL-Connector-Java-8.0.29.
Make sure that MYSQL-Connector-Java-8.0.29 is placed in a folder called "lib" in the root directory of the program.

Login using username "test" and password "test". The feature to login or add new users has not been
implemented per the class instructions.

Use the combo / dropdown boxes in the top right part of the "Calendar" for the following:
- Add Appointment or Customer
- Update existing Appointment or Customer
- Delete existing Appointment or Customer

You can also click on the "Reports" button in the top-right corner to run a report from data already in the database.
The third report I chose to create was to count the number of customers that are currently in the database. This feature
can be expanded upon to count number of customers from specific countries or timezones, depending on feedback from the
client.

Scenario
--------------------------------------------
You are working for a software company that has been contracted to develop a GUI-based scheduling desktop application.
The contract is with a global consulting organization that conducts business in multiple languages and has main offices in Phoenix, Arizona;
White Plains, New York; Montreal, Canada; and London, England.
The consulting organization has provided a MySQL database that the application must pull data from.
The database is used for other systems, so its structure cannot be modified.

The organization outlined specific business requirements that must be met as part of the application.
From these requirements, a system analyst at your company created solution statements for you to implement in developing the application.
These statements are listed in the requirements section.

Your company acquires Country and First-Level-Division data from a third party that is updated once per year.
These tables are pre-populated with read-only data. Please use the attachment “Locale Codes for Region and Language” to review division data.
Your company also supplies a list of contacts, which are pre-populated in the Contacts table; however,
administrative functions such as adding users are beyond the scope of the application and done by your company’s IT support staff.
Your application should be organized logically using one or more design patterns and generously commented using
Javadoc so your code can be read and maintained by other programmers.
